### Hi there fellow GitHub members and vistors ðŸ‘‹

Studying at TEC in Denmark (https://www.tec.dk/erhvervsuddannelser/vaelg-erhvervsuddannelse/data-og-kommunikationsuddannelsen/  ) I was at the Datatechnician program where I had chosen to specialize in programming, however life changed my plans and I am now taking a shorter education to become a IT supporter instead and will learn the rest in my free time since programming still fascinates me.

My aim with this is to become that one IT person you trust to fix it when you "just need it to work" or "need your system to become effective and less of a waste of time and company money"

Code and Programs fascinate me as there are endless ways of solutions and can always be improved if one wishes to do so However I decided that I need to get to work soon so Im now studying IT sopporter instead and will teach myself programming from anything that I can find online

- Iâ€™m currently working on finding the knowledge about how things are connected
and what tools will be helpful for the future plans that I have in mind
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying IT supporter instead and have decided to learn coding by myself in my free time
