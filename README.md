### Hi there fellow GitHub members and vistors ðŸ‘‹

Studying at TEC in Frederiksberg, Denmark (https://www.tec.dk/erhvervsuddannelser/vaelg-erhvervsuddannelse/data-og-kommunikationsuddannelsen/  ) I'm at the Datatechnician program and have chosen to specialize in programming.

My aim with becoming a programmer is to become that one IT person you trust to fix it when you "just need your program to work" or "need your system to become effective and less of a waste of time and company money" 

Code and Programs fascinate me as there are endless ways of solutions and can always be improved if one wishes to do so

- Iâ€™m currently working on finding the knowledge about how things are connected
and what tools will be helpful for the future career that I have in mind
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of things as IÂ´m studying Programming at my school
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ct88ice@gmail.com or c.tegnegren@gmail.com

My website ct88ice.tech is a recently started project and will be updated
